                <p>The most successful AI systems work in harmony with human thought processes. This doesn't happen by accident – it requires deep understanding of both cognitive science and AI engineering.</p>
                <p>Think of it this way: Just as a well-designed tool feels like a natural extension of your hand, an AI system should feel like a natural extension of human cognitive capabilities. This only happens when we deeply understand both the tool and the human mind.</p>
